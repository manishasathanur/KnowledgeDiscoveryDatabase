A new study has found that high levels of consumption of red and processed meat are associated with an increased risk of 

 colorectal cancer , whereas high levels of fish consumption are associated with a decreased risk of the disease.    
Elio Riboli, M.D., M.P.H., and Teresa Norat M.S., M.P.H., of the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, 

and colleagues used data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a cohort of more than 

half a million Western Europeans, to examine the associations between intakes of red and processed meat, poultry, and fish 

and colorectal cancer risk.    
During a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 1,329 cases of colorectal cancer were documented. Among the study population, the risk 

of developing colorectal cancer over 10 years was 1.71% for subjects in the highest category of red and processed meat 

consumption compared with 1.28% for subjects in the lowest category. The risk of developing colorectal cancer was 1.86% among 

subjects in the lowest category of fish consumption compared with 1.28% among subjects in the highest category. There was no 

association between poultry consumption and colorectal cancer risk.
