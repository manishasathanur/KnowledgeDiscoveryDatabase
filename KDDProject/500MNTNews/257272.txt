A report on the work, by a team from Universit√© Laval in Canada, can be found in the 

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.Many people have some degree of gum inflammation, or gingivitis, that results from the build-up of 

dental plaque containing bacteria. However, if the inflammation persists, it eventually leads to gum or 

periodontal disease.If the bacterial plaque is not removed - for example, by regular brushing and gum care - it 

leads to a much harder deposit called tartar that only a dental health professional can remove to stop 

the periodontal disease process.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly half of American adults aged 30 

and over have some form of periodontal disease.In severe cases of periodontal disease, the dentist may also prescribe antibiotics to fight the 

infection.

The team behind the new study has been investigating a range of natural antibacterial compounds to 

fight gum disease. More recently they began to look at blueberry polyphenols, which are known to 

protect plants against some diseases.They wondered if the compounds - which they found in extracts from the wild lowbush blueberry, 

Vaccinium angustifolium Ait. - might have an effect on Fusobacterium nucleatum, a 

bacterium that plays a key role in gum disease.Lab tests showed the compounds successfully stopped the bacterium growing and forming 

biofilms. Tests on macrophages - immune system cells that play a key role in inflammation - also showed 

that the polyphenol-rich extract blocked a molecular pathway that is involved in 

inflammation.Biofilms are precursors to plaques. They consist of a matrix of substances the bacteria cells 

produce and in which they embed themselves.The researchers conclude:"This dual antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action of lowbush blueberry polyphenols 

suggests that they may be promising candidates for novel therapeutic agents."The team is now developing an oral device that slowly releases the extract after deep cleaning to 

help treat gum disease.Poor gum health has also been linked to a number of other diseases. For example, Medical News 

Today has learned that improving gum health may reduce heart 

risk, and that poor oral hygiene or gum disease is linked to higher 

risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
