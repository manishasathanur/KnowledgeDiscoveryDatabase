Common mental disorders, such as  depression  and  anxiety , now account for more incapacity benefit claims than 

musculoskeletal conditions like low  back pain , say researchers in this week's BMJ.    
Long term sickness absence is a major public health and economic problem. In 2003, 176 million working days were lost; up 10 

million on the previous year. Each year, ï¿½13bn are spent on benefits, and the reduction of long term sick leave is now a top 

government priority.    
Until recently, the most common causes of long term sickness absence were musculoskeletal disorders, in particular low back 

pain, but over the last decade, the contribution of psychiatric disorders has increased markedly. Since 1995, the number of 

people reporting  stress  that was caused or made worse by their work has doubled, and common mental disorders are now the 

leading cause of sickness absence.    
These disorders are managed almost entirely in primary care, but with limited capacity for psychological therapies, waiting 

times are often long. The United Kingdom also has very poor provision of occupational physicians (one specialist for every 

43,000 workers) compared with the rest of Europe.    
Both employers and patients require a speedier response than is currently delivered, as the longer an individual remains off 

work, the more difficult a return becomes. 
If the government is serious about tackling the consequences of common mental disorders then innovative policies, including a 

major expansion in occupational health and psychological therapy services in primary care, will be required alongside 

research into the most effective and cost effective methods of delivering service, say the authors.    
This would be a wise investment given the substantial economic and social costs engendered by the current service framework, 

they conclude.
