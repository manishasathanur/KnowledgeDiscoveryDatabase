This study describes early poststroke emotional recovery in veterans. One hundred and twelve veterans discharged from the hospital one month poststroke completed in-home interviews and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), which were compared to evidence of  depression  from patient records.    Data indicated that 35 percent of the veterans were depressed.    Respondents who were depressed were struggling with low expectations of recovery and finding it difficult to accept the losses they were experiencing.    Few participants were diagnosed with a depressive disorder. Screening with the GDS is a first step in the detection of depression in patients recovering from  stroke .    

One-third of veterans recovering from stroke suffer from depression, pg. 277
