quinoa buckwheat wholegrain wheat brown rice bran barley In addition lower glycemic index compared wheat flour many whole grains offer number nutrients like zinc vitamin E protein Sandwich bread option Tortillas provide tasty versatile sometimes healthier choice sandwiches As diabetes epidemic continues escalate worldwide companies pushing wider range lowcarbohydrate tortillas appeal healthconscious consumers Many lowcarbohydrate tortillas available market added fiber reduce carbohydrate count Some tortillas simply made lowcarbohydrate ingredients like whey soy protein powders People use lowcarbohydrate tortillas would use bread wrapping favorite sandwich ingredients tortilla Tortillas also used mini pizzas homemade burritos tacos Perhaps best choice diabetesfriendly bread
